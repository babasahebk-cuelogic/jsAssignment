What is JavaScript: 
=> JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”.
=> Scripts are provided and executed as plain text.
=> initially name is LiveScript.
=> JavaScript Do: 
   => Add new HTML to the page, change the existing content, modify styles.
   => React to user actions, run on mouse clicks, pointer movements, key presses.
   => Send requests over the network to remote servers, download and upload files (so-called AJAX and COMET technologies).
   => Get and set cookies, ask questions to the visitor, show messages.
   => Remember the data on the client-side (“local storage”).
=> What makes JavaScript unique?
   => Full integration with HTML/CSS.
   => Simple things are done simply.
   => Support by all major browsers and enabled by default.
=> Same as JavaScript
    => CoffeeScript,  TypeScript, Dart

Variables: 
=> Variables are used to store this information.
=> A variable is a “named storage” for data,  to store goodies, visitors, and other data
=> use the "let" keyword to create a variable.
Variable Naming:
    => The name must contain only letters, digits, or the symbols $ and _.
    => The first character must not be a digit.
Constants: 
=> To declare a constant (unchanging) variable, use const instead of let:

Data types:
=> Programming languages that allow such things are called “dynamically typed”
1) Number
=> let num = 255;
=> Math.floor: Rounds down: 3.1 becomes 3, and -1.1 becomes -2.
=> Math.ceil: Rounds up: 3.1 becomes 4, and -1.1 becomes -1.
=> Math.round: Rounds to the nearest integer: 3.1 becomes 3, 3.6 becomes 4 and -1.1 becomes -1.
=> toFixed(n): rounds the number to n digits after the point and returns a string 
=> isFinite and isNaN
    Infinity (and -Infinity) is a special numeric value that is greater (less) than anything.
    NaN represents an error.
=> isNaN(value)
=> Math.random(1,5);
=> Math.randomInteger(1,5);
=> Math.parseInt('123.255px');
=> Math.parseFloat('123.255px');

String: 
let str = "Hello";
let str2 = 'Single quotes are ok too';
let phrase = `can embed ${str}`;


There are 7 basic data types in JavaScript.

number for numbers of any kind: integer or floating-point.
string for strings. A string may have one or more characters, there’s no separate single-character type.
boolean for true/false.
null for unknown values – a standalone type that has a single value null.
undefined for unassigned values – a standalone type that has a single value undefined.
object for more complex data structures.
symbol for unique identifiers.
